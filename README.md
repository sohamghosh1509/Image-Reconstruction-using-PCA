# Image Reconstruction Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

This project explores image reconstruction and classification using eigen projections derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA).  

## Key Features  

- Reconstructed images from the **AT&T face dataset** using eigen projections derived from PCA.  
- Analyzed the impact of varying the number of principal components on image reconstruction, measured using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.  
- Achieved an accuracy of **92.5%** with **10 principal components** for class label prediction on each test image.  

## Dataset  

The project uses the **AT&T face dataset**, a widely-used dataset for face recognition tasks. It consists of grayscale face images of 40 individuals, each having 10 images.
